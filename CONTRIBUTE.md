 ## Ways of Contributing: 
 
 There are three ways: 
 
 <ol>
   <li>
    Modify the README.md's HTML code <b>(follow example (1))</b> such that you add a new free link that directs to the book that you want to be added to the respective category (if the category does not exist create it). 
   </li>
   <li>
     Upload the particular book you want to be added to your own personal drive account and then modify the README.md file by following the example (1).
   </li>
   <li>
     Make a pull request of the book you want to be added by providing the free download link, and I will personally add it to my drive account and then add it to the repo.
  </li>
 </ol>
